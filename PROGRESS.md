### Phase 3 gate: PASSED (2026-10-17)

| Commit | Work |
|---|---|
| `16d7857` | B1 — `core/rateLimiter.ts`, synchronous reservation |
| `f436a01` | `core/cache.ts` — LRU+TTL, canonical keys, singleflight, frozen values |
| `281dcfa` | B15 — `core/quota.ts`, real quota in the resource and in `_meta` |
| `4b7237a` | Shared `deps` across HTTP sessions + three bugs it surfaced |

**Gate criteria, all verified:**

| Criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|
| (a) 2 HTTP sessions share one limiter and cache; 2nd identical call = 0 fetches | `sharedState.test.ts` over real HTTP sessions |
| (b) 5 concurrent identical calls = 1 upstream fetch | `sharedState.test.ts`, `cacheIntegration.test.ts` |
| (c) expired entries evicted, cache bounded | `cache.test.ts` (LRU eviction proven by which key re-produces), 20 distinct searches bounded to 5 |
| (d) cancellation aborts an in-flight fetch and a limiter wait | `cancellation.test.ts`, `rateLimiterConcurrency.test.ts` |
| (e) quota exhaustion fails fast, no retries | `errorHandling.test.ts`, `sharedState.test.ts` |

**B1 fix, quantified.** Before: 60 concurrent callers all passed the check together
(60 admissions in 41 ms; 84 requests in the first second) against a 25/s limit.
Now `acquire()` reserves the slot **synchronously** before any `await`; the
regression test asserts exactly 25 admissions from 100 concurrent callers before
the clock moves, that window accounting never exceeds capacity, and that admitting
100 calls consumes at least 3000 virtual ms at 25/s. The clock is injected, so
these are deterministic, not sleep-dependent.

**Three bugs the new gate test found (all fixed, all now covered):**

1. Only *search* responses were cached — answers, comments and
   `search_by_question_id` hit the API every time, so the "second identical call
   costs nothing" guarantee did not hold for that tool at all. A generic
   `cachedRead` now covers every read path.
2. A shared singleflight producer captured **one caller's `AbortSignal`**, so
   cancelling the caller that happened to start a request also failed its
   siblings. Cached producers now take no caller signal; each caller races the
   shared result against its own.
3. `GET /mcp` passed `null` as the pre-parsed body, which the SDK validates as a
   JSON-RPC message (ZodError). The argument is now omitted.

**Also fixed in the test harness:** the fetch stub now intercepts only the Stack
Exchange API. It had been swallowing the MCP client's own HTTP traffic, which
produced failures that looked like code bugs but were harness bugs.

**Suite is now 25 suites / 155 tests / 0 skipped** (baseline: 8 / 30 / 1). The
contract snapshot and fetch budget are still unchanged, so no published behaviour
moved.

**New env var:** `RATE_LIMIT_RPS` (default 25).

## Phase checklist

- [x] Phase 2 — Modularize (pure refactor) — see ADR 0001
- [x] Phase 3 — Shared core (rate limiter, cache, quota, HTTP client)
- [ ] Phase 4 — API-call reduction
- [ ] Phase 5 — MCP protocol polish
- [ ] Phase 6 — HTTP transport hardening
- [ ] Phase 7 — Config, logging, security pass
- [ ] Phase 8 — Tooling and CI

- [ ] Phase 10 — Documentation
- [ ] Phase 11 — Final verification and handoff

## Environment

- Repo: `/home/sameer/Shared/Sync/Private/Apps/services/mcp/stackoverflow-mcp`
- Branch: `hardening/v0.3` (off `main` @ `ec00d96`)
- Node v26.3.0, npm 9.2.0 (systemd unit pins node 26.3.0)
- `node_modules` present, `package-lock.json` present (208 KB). No yarn/pnpm lock.
- Baseline (verified 2026-10-17): `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0; `npm test` → **8 suites, 30 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed**.

## Surface inventory (baseline `ec00d96`)

Verified by reading `src/index.ts` (1,877 lines, single file) and `src/types/index.ts`.

### Tools (5) — all `readOnlyHint: true, idempotentHint: true, openWorldHint: true`, no `destructiveHint`

| Tool | Params (registration `inputSchema`) | Strictness actually enforced |
|---|---|---|
| `search_by_error` | `errorMessage` (req), `language?`, `technologies?[]`, `minScore?`, `includeComments?`, `responseFormat?`, `limit?`, `page?` | zod in `types/` adds trim/min(1)/max(2000), int/positive/max(100), nonnegative |
| `search_by_tags` | `tags` (req, string[]), `minScore?`, `includeComments?`, `responseFormat?`, `limit?`, `page?` | `tags` min(1) |
| `analyze_stack_trace` | `stackTrace` (req), `language` (req), `includeComments?`, `responseFormat?`, `limit?`, `page?` | max(10000) |
| `search_by_query` | `query` (req), `tags?[]`, `minScore?`, `acceptedOnly?`, `includeComments?`, `responseFormat?`, `limit?`, `page?` | max(2000) |
| `search_by_question_id` | `questionId` (req), `includeAnswers?` (default true), `includeComments?`, `responseFormat?` | int/positive |

**3.5 confirmed:** the registration `inputSchema` is a hand-written duplicate that does **not** advertise `max(100)`, `int()`, `positive()`, `nonnegative()`, `min(1)`, `max(2000)`, `max(10000)`. LLMs cannot see the limits.

### Resources (2)
- `server-status` → `stackoverflow://status` (service, version, transport, apiKeyConfigured, timestamp)
- `api-quota` → `stackoverflow://quota` (maxRequestsPerSecond, minDelayBetweenRequestsMs, quotaWarningThreshold, cacheTtlMs, activeBackoffs, timestamp)
- Server capabilities declare `tools/resources/prompts` only — **no `notifications`**, so resource-updated notifications are not advertised.

### Prompts (2)
- `stackoverflow_search` (`query` req, `language` opt)
- `stackoverflow_debug` (`errorMessage` req, `language` req)

### Baseline constants
`MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND=25`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=1000`, `MIN_DELAY_BETWEEN_REQUESTS_MS=40`, `RETRY_AFTER_MS=100`, `QUOTA_WARNING_THRESHOLD=100`, `CHARACTER_LIMIT=25000`, `MAX_ANSWERS=5`, `MAX_QUESTION_BODY_CHARS=5000`, `MAX_ANSWER_BODY_CHARS=3000`, `cacheTtlMs=5*60*1000`.
Filters: `DEFAULT_FILTER='withbody'`, `ANSWER_FILTER='withbody'`, `COMMENT_FILTER='default'`.

## API-call budget table (tool → calls per invocation)

Baseline numbers read from source. "worst" = every query variant empty until the last, plus tag relaxation.

| Tool | Search | Answers | Comments | Worst total | Best total | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `search_by_error` | ≤5 | 1 | 0–1 | **7** | **2** | 4 query variants + 1 tag-relax attempt |
| `analyze_stack_trace` | ≤5 | 1 | 0–1 | **7** | **2** | same variant ladder |
| `search_by_query` | ≤5 | 1 | 0–1 | **7** | **2** | same |
| `search_by_tags` | 1 | 1 | 0–1 | **3** | **2** | no variant ladder |
| `search_by_question_id` | 1 | 1 | 0–1 | **3** | **2** | `includeAnswers:false` → 1 |

**With `includeComments:true` the worst case is unbounded today** because comment IDs (questions + *all* answers) are passed in one vectorized call and are not chunked (B2). At 5 results whose questions each return up to 100 answers, `postIds.length` reaches 505 in a single request.

**After Phase 3 (measured):** every read path is cached, so a repeated identical
request now costs **0** calls, and concurrent identical requests collapse to 1.
`search_by_question_id` is 1–3 on a cold cache (question + answers + comments).

**After (targets, Phase 4):** typical `search_by_error` ≤1–2 calls; `includeComments` ≤2; `search_by_question_id` ≤1.

### Verified upstream limits (to confirm against official docs in Phase 4)
- Vectorized requests (`/questions/{ids}/answers`, `/posts/{ids}/comments`): **max 100 semicolon-separated IDs per call** (source of B2).
- Default `pagesize` when unset: **30** (source of B5).
- Quota: ~300/day per IP without a key, ~10,000 with a key.
- Concurrency throttle: 30 req/s.
- `min` is rejected together with `sort=relevance` (`error_id 400`) — already handled in code.

## Bug evidence — measured at baseline (not assumed)

A temporary probe suite was run against `ec00d96` and deleted afterwards. Raw results:

| ID | Claim | Measured at baseline | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| ★B1 | `checkRateLimit` not concurrency-safe | **60 concurrent admissions in 41 ms** with a 25/s limit (task's independent measurement: 84 in the first second) | **CONFIRMED** |
| ★B2 | Comment ID list not chunked to ≤100 | **1 request with 144 semicolon-separated IDs** (4 questions + 160 answers) to `/posts/…/comments` | **CONFIRMED** (real API would reject) |
| ★B6 | `createErrorResponse` doesn't redact `key=` | `…&key=SECRET123` **passed through verbatim** (`leaks SECRET123: true`) | **CONFIRMED** |
| B5 | No default `limit` | `limit` unset → **no `pagesize` param at all**, so the API default of 30 applies: `site=stackoverflow&sort=relevance&order=desc&filter=withbody&q=boom` | **CONFIRMED** |

## Additional Phase 0 findings (new, not in the original audit)

- **Config is frozen at module load.** `runtimeEnvSchema.parse(...)` runs at import time, so `STACKFLOW_API_KEY`/`PORT` cannot be injected per instance; a test that sets the env var after import gets no key. `fetchCounts.test.ts` documents this and works around it with `jest.resetModules()`. Fixing it properly is Phase 7 (`config.ts` + injected deps). This is what blocks the "dependencies injected (clock, fetch, config)" style rule in §6.
- **The contract snapshot revealed a third published field:** the SDK advertises `execution: { taskSupport: 'forbidden' }` for every tool. Harmless, but it must stay in the snapshot baseline.
- **Schema drift confirmed with evidence:** the published `search_by_error` schema shows `errorMessage: { type: 'string' }` with **no `maxLength`**, and `limit: { type: 'number' }` with **no `integer`/`minimum`/`maximum`** — so the zod constraints in `src/types/index.ts` are invisible to clients (finding 3.5).


### MCP TypeScript SDK `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0` (verified against installed `.d.ts`/`.js`; context7 unavailable — see "Known issues")
- `McpServer.registerTool<OutputArgs, InputArgs>(name, config, cb)` with
  `config = { title?, description?, inputSchema?, outputSchema?, annotations?, _meta? }`.
  `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` accept `ZodRawShapeCompat | AnySchema`.
  Source: `node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/server/mcp.d.ts:150-157`.
- `ToolCallback` signature: `(args, extra: RequestHandlerExtra<ServerRequest, ServerNotification>) => CallToolResult | Promise<CallToolResult>` (`mcp.d.ts:250-261`).
- `RequestHandlerExtra.signal: AbortSignal` — **non-optional**; "used to communicate if the request was cancelled from the sender's side" (`shared/protocol.d.ts:173-177`). Also `authInfo?`, `sessionId?`, `_meta?`, `requestId`.
- `CallToolResult.structuredContent?: Record<string, unknown>` (`types.d.ts:2601` etc.). Docs comment at `mcp.d.ts:257-258`: return `structuredContent` if the tool has an `outputSchema`, `content` if not.
- `InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair(): [InMemoryTransport, InMemoryTransport]` → `[client, server]` (`esm/inMemory.d.ts`).
- `createMcpExpressApp(options?: { host?: string; allowedHosts?: string[] }): Express` — defaults `host='127.0.0.1'`; auto-applies `localhostHostValidation()` when host is `127.0.0.1|localhost|::1`; applies `hostHeaderValidation(allowedHosts)` when `allowedHosts` given.
  **Important:** its implementation does `app.use(express.json())` with the **default 100 KB limit** — we must account for that (Phase 6).
- `hostHeaderValidation(allowedHostnames: string[]): RequestHandler` — matches hostname **port-agnostically**; rejects with HTTP 403 + JSON-RPC `-32000`. `localhostHostValidation()` allows `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`.
- `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` options confirmed present: `sessionIdGenerator`, `enableJsonResponse`, `onsessioninitialized`, `onsessionclosed`, `eventStore` (already used: `sessionIdGenerator`, `enableJsonResponse`, `onsessioninitialized`).

### pino
- `utils/logger.ts` already writes to fd 2 (`pino.destination(2)`) → stderr-only is already satisfied; `redact` list is top-level only (B6 gap).

## Decisions (link ADRs)

_(none yet — ADRs start in Phase 2: `docs/adr/0001-module-layout.md`)_

## Test-harness facts (needed by every later phase)

- `jest.config.js`: preset `ts-jest/presets/default-esm`; `extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.ts']`; `moduleNameMapper` strips `.js` from relative imports; `testMatch: ["**/src/__tests__/**/*.test.ts"]`; `resolver: "jest-ts-webcompat-resolver"`; **deprecated `globals['ts-jest']`** block (warns 3× per run).
- `npm test` = `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules jest`.
- Every test file imports `../index.js`, which **runs `main()` on import** → each test file boots a real stdio server (B10). Visible in baseline logs.
- Tests fake `fetch` by assigning `global.fetch` and restore it in `afterEach`.
- 8 suites / 31 tests. `rateLimiting.test.ts` has one `test.skip` (the real concurrency test) — to be rewritten in Phase 3.
- **Contract tension:** `regressionFixes.test.ts` contains `"tool handlers must not return structuredContent"`, which directly contradicts B11/Phase 5 (restoring `structuredContent`). It must be rewritten in Phase 5 with a CHANGELOG "Changed" entry. `git show 4115cb1` holds the removed implementation for reference.
- `apiIntegration.test.ts` monkey-patches `(server as any).server = { connect, close }` to avoid connecting. New tests should prefer a real `InMemoryTransport` pair instead of monkey-patching.

## Known issues / deferred

- **context7 is unavailable in this environment** (`Invalid API key … should start with 'ctx7sk'`). Fallback per the task's own instruction: grep-github + the installed package's own `.d.ts`/`.js` (authoritative for the installed version) + official docs via fetch. Recorded, not blocking.
- `build/` is committed? No — `build/` is gitignored but present on disk (from `prepare`).
- `service.log` (root-owned, 313 KB) and `my.db` exist in the working tree but are correctly gitignored (`.gitignore` covers `*.log`, `*.db`, `.env*`). **Never commit these.** Tracked files verified clean.
- Pre-existing oddity: `scripts/verify.mjs` and `scripts/probe.mjs` spawn `node build/index.js` — they depend on the built output.

## Questions for the owner (batch — do not block work)

1. **Default `limit` of 5 when unset (B5):** acceptable? It changes default output size. *(Default chosen: 5; recorded in CHANGELOG.)*
2. **npm package name/scope and maintainer metadata** (Phase 9): keep `@gscalzo/stackoverflow-mcp` (upstream scope, cannot publish), or rename to `@sameersemna/stackoverflow-mcp` + fix `repository`/`bugs`/`homepage` to `sameersemna/stackoverflow-mcp`?
3. **Replace the `mcp-proxy` wrapper** with the native streamable-HTTP transport in the systemd unit and `run.sh`? (Owner's current unit must keep working until they approve.)
4. **Delete or archive the 8 legacy `scripts/*.mjs`** after consolidating into `scripts/smoke.mjs`? (Plan: move to `scripts/legacy/` meanwhile.)
5. **Enable the persistent on-disk cache by default** for the systemd deployment? (Plan: off by default, opt-in via `SO_MCP_CACHE_DIR`.)

## Next action (exact)

**Phase 4.1 — API-call reduction. Read the official docs *before* coding.**

1. **sequential-thinking + architect** → `docs/adr/0003-api-efficiency.md`.
2. Fetch the official Stack Exchange documentation with the `fetch` tool and
   record the verified limits in the "Verified upstream limits" section below:
   - `https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/filters` — is a custom filter immutable
     once created, and is its id stable/safe to hard-code? This is the single
     biggest remaining quota win (a typical search from 2–3 calls to 1).
   - `https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/vectors` — confirm the 100-ID cap that
     B2 works around, so the constant is documented rather than assumed.
   - `https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/throttle` — confirm the per-day quota
     (300 anonymous / 10,000 keyed) and the backoff semantics.
   - `https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/tags-synonyms` — the endpoint for
     B13 tag normalization.
3. Then, in this order, one commit each:
   - **custom filter**: `scripts/create-filter.mjs` (one live call, opt-in) and
     the filter string as a documented constant, with the `withbody` + separate
     calls path kept as a fallback that flips a process flag on
     `error_id 400/404`.
   - **B13 tag normalization** (lowercase, trim, spaces→hyphens, dedupe, sort for
     cache keys) + synonym resolution cached ≥24 h via `/tags/{tags}/synonyms`.
   - update the budget table with **measured** before/after numbers from the
     fetch-count harness.
4. Gate: typical `search_by_error` without comments ≤1–2 calls (from 2–6); with
   comments ≤2; `search_by_question_id` ≤1; and the formatted output on fixtures
   must be unchanged (the `formattingFidelity` semantics and the contract
   snapshot are the tripwires).
